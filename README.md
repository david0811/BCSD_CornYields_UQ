To reproduce the analysis start to finish, run the scripts in the order of the filenames.

***Note:*** Some of the data files in this repository are stored with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) but can also be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4455847). The calculation of county-level degree days from the native NEX-GDDP and CMIP netcdf files was performed offline, but you can find scripts showing the basic structure in `other`.
